EtherCAT master TODO

$Id$

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Issues for release 1.3.0:
  - Take broadcast MAC address to register the first ethernet device.
  - Limit EEPROM reading.
  - Implement ecrt_get_slave() with integer argument as ring position.
  - Handle missing rc_status in init script.

* Future features:
  - Interface/buffers for asynchronous domain IO.
  - Distributed clocks.
  - Dynamic PDO mapping from SDO dictionary (see can-cia.org: cia301ds4).
  - Redundancy with 2 network adapters.
  - Mailbox handler
  - Support slaves, that don't support the LRW datagram, only LRD/LWR.

* Smaller issues:
  - Clear sync managers in INIT.
  - Simplify FSMs with <state>_enter() functions.
  - Output intermediate results during lsec.
  - State change FSM: Follow spontaneous state changes.
  - Read out CRC counters.
  - Calculate expected working counter for domains.
  - Optimize alignment of process data.
  - Evaluate EEPROM contents after writing.
  - SDO write access in sysfs.
  - Configure slave ports to automatically open on link detection.
  - Calculate cycle time of operation state machine.
  - Locking for serveral slave variables for sysfs access.
  - Interrupt master state machines state scan for other jobs.
  - Master state machine, slave configuration: Do not check every slave on
    a cycle.
  - Do only execute one EoE handler per EoE cycle.

* Less important issues:
  - Implement all EtherCAT datagram types.
  - File access over EtherCAT (FoE).
  - Allow VLAN tagging.
  - Determine number of frames the NIC can handle.
