This is a minimal example application for the use of the EtherCAT
master realtime RTDM interface with an XENOMAI POSIX thread.

The application expects an XENOMAI installation. Configure the master sources
specifying --enable-rtdm --with-xenomai-dir to have the right include paths.

Most probably you'll have different EtherCAT slaves present. Try adjusting the
section "process data" in main.c to your bus configuration.

There are some features that can be disabled by commenting out the respective
defines at the head of main.c.

---

To build the example, call:

make 

To run it, preload the EtherCAT RTDM module:

modprobe ec_rtdm

and call as root:

./ec_xenomai_posix_example

...and watch the system logs for the outputs.
