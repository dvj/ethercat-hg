This is the FEATURES file of the IgH EtherCAT Master.

$Id$

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Features:

* Runs as kernel module for Linux 2.6.

* Comes with EtherCAT-capable network driver for RTL8139 and compatible
  network interface cards.
  - Interrupt-less network driver operation.
  - Easy implementation of additional network drivers through common device
    interface of the master.
  - Runs even with PCMCIA cards.

* Supports multiple EtherCAT masters on one machine.

* Supports any realtime extension through independent architecture.
  - RTAI, IPIPE, ADEOS, etc.
  - Runs well even without realtime extensions.

* Common kernel interface, for realtime modules using EtherCAT functionality.
  - Synchronous and asynchronous sending and receiving of frames.
  - Avoidance of unnecessary copy operations for process data.

* Separating slave groups through domains.
  - Handling of multiple slave groups with different sampling rates.
  - Automatic calculation of process data mapping, FMMU- and sync manager
    configuration within the domains.

* Master finite state machine (FSM). Thus:
  - Bus monitoring during realtime operation.
  - Automatic reconfiguration of slaves on bus power failure during realtime
    operation.
  - Controlling of slave states during realtime operation.

* Free-Run mode, if master is idle.
  - Automatic scanning of slaves upon topology changes.
  - Bus visualisation and EoE processing without realtime process connected.

* Implements the CANopen-over-EtherCAT (CoE) protocol.
  - Configuration of CoE-capable slaves via SDO interface.
  - SDO dictionary listing.

* Implements the Ethernet-over-EtherCAT (EoE) protocol.
  - Creates virtual network devices that are automatically coupled to
    EoE-capable	slaves.
  - Thus natively supports either a switched or a routed EoE network
    architecture.

* User space interface via the System Filesystem (SysFS).
  - User space tool for bus visualisation.
  - Slave EÂ²PROM image reading and writing.

* Seamless integration in your favourite Linux distibution.
  - Master and network device configuration via sysconfig files.
  - UnitedLinux compatible init script for master control.

* Virtual read-only network interface for debugging purposes and for
  "sniffing" the EtherCAT traffic (through Ethereal, or others).
