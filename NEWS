Changes in version 1.3.0:

* Added Intel PRO/100 ethernet driver (e100).
* Added ethernet driver for NVIDIA nForce chipsets (forcedeth).
* Removed "ec_eoeif_count" master module parameter.
* Introduced "Device IDs" to tell a master to wait for connection of certain
  ethernet devices.
* Added "main" and "backup" parameters to master module to hand over
  device ID lists.
* Changed format of sysconfig file and accordingly adjusted functionality
  of the init script to handle device ID lists.
* Realtime interface changes:
  - Added ecrt_master_get_status() to get information about the bus.
* Device interface changes:
  - Replaced ecdev_register() and ecdev_unregister() with ecdev_offer() and
    ecdev_withdraw(), respectively. The device modules now offer all their
    devices to the master, which decides, which ones to register.
* All EEPROM write operations from user space are now blocking until
  writing has finished and return appropriate error codes.
* Implemented setting of secondary slave address (alias) via sysfs.
* Removed annoying eeprom_write_enable file. EEPROM writing always enabled.
* Removed EtherCAT line comments from 8139too drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 1.2.0:

* Serveral fixes of bugs and stability issues. Master should now run fine
  with kernels 2.6.17 to 2.6.19.
* Realtime interface changes:
  - Re-introduced ecrt_domain_queue() to allow datagram queuing apart
    from datagram processing. The queuing of a domain's datagrams is not
    done in ecrt_domain_process() any more!
  - Removed ecrt_master_deactivate(). Its functionality was moved into
    ecrt_master_release().
  - Removed ecrt_master_prepare(). Its functionality was moved into
    ecrt_master_activate().
  - Renamed ecdev_start() and ecdev_stop() to ecdev_open() and ecdev_close().
    These two functions now take a pointer to ec_device_t as their arguments.
  - The data_ptr parameter of ecrt_domain_register_pdo(),
    ecrt_domain_register_pdo_list() and ecrt_domain_register_pdo_range() may
    not be NULL any more.
  - Removed ecrt_slave_pdo_size(). This function was deprecated long before.
  - Introduced ECRT_VERSION_MAGIC macro and ecrt_version_magic() function.
* Device interface changes:
  - ec_isr_t was replaced by ec_pollfunc_t, the device driver has to supply
    a poll function to call its ISR. This was introduced because some network
    drivers' interrupt functions have different arguments.
* State machines now try to re-send datagrams on datagram timeout.
* New option -c of the lsec script, displays slave current consumptions and
  remaining current.
* Added frame counter in master info file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 1.1.1:

* State change FSM: Clearing of sync managers before PREOP.
* Added modules_install make target.
* Device modules for kernel 2.6.17.
* SDO configurations available in Sysfs.
* FMMU configurations cleared when going to INIT.
* Slave-specific logs only at debug level 1 (for large busses).
* Slave flags (error, online) available in Sysfs.
* Acknowledging of spontaneous state changes in master FSMs.
* ecrt_master_deactivate() deprecated.
* Persistent slave lists. Slave structures are only regenerated on topology
  change in IDLE mode.
* SDO reading via Sysfs.
* Added ecrt_domain_register_pdo_range()
* Fetching of SDO dictionary.
* Better timing behaviour when starting up under high CPU load.
* Applied Autotools.
* Improved output of lsec.
* SDO download state machine.
