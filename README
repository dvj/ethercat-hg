1) General Information
======================

This is an Open-Source EtherCAT master implementation for Linux 2.6.

See the FEATURES file for a list of features. For more information, see

2) Requirements
===============

1) Software requirements

Configured sources for the Linux 2.6 kernel are required to build the EtherCAT
master.

2) Hardware requirements

The EtherCAT master needs a RTL8139 (or compatible) network interface card to
run. Drivers for other widespread devices (i. e. Intel PRO/100) will be
implemented soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Building and installing
==========================

See the INSTALL file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Realtime & Tuning
====================

Realtime patches for the Linux kernel are supported, but not required. The
realtime processing has to be done by the calling module (see API
documentation). The EtherCAT master code itself is completely passive (except
for the idle mode).

To avoid frame timeouts, deactivating DMA access for hard drives is
recommented (hdparm -d0 <DEV>).
